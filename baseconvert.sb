'base converter by Matojeje. V1 for SmallBasic 1.2 | 29 and 30.10.2016

'Why a separate program?
'Because I asked LitDev (creator of the awesome LD plugins) on the SmallBasic forums to make more
'number bases available in LDMath.Decimal2Base and LDMath.Base2Decimal, and he added it there,
'but the plugin was no longer working for SB v1.0 I usually use, and SB v1.2 which is compatible with
'the newest versions of his plugins doesn't want to read the extensions for SB v1.0... And I really need
'the extensions because I always use GameWindow from DataPlugin, never GraphicsWindow. I just
'need to use V1.0, alright? And why didn't I update the plugins to SB 1.2?    ...   I dunno. I'm lazy. =w=

'To use this, launch the EXE file with an argument, which is a deviantion ID with a prefix that changes
'depending on the format of the ID. If it's a decimal ID, write [dec_]. If it's a hexatrigesimal number,
'(that means mixed letters and numbers, usually appears in fav.me links) write [dA_]. Both should be
'written without the square brackets and if you're getting the hexatrigesimal thingy from a fav.me
'link, the first letter is probably lowercase D. remove that, it's not a part of the value. If you're confused,
'just remove the  "fav.me/d"  part and replace it with  "dA_"  . When we're talking about the deviation
'ID, you should be able to find that in the drawing's URL, for recent deviations it's about nine numbers
'long. Did you know that as long as the ID in the URL stays the same, you can play with the URL like
'changing the nickname subdomain or the deviation name, and you still get linked to the same thing.
'You can also just change it to deviantart.com/deviation/{ID} and hide the nickname and submission
'name that way. But anyways, i'm getting too far away from the tutorial on using this. Simply call it
'with LDProcess.Start("[path]\baseconvert.sb",[dA deviation ID]). For example:

'LDProcess.Start((Program.Directory)+"\baseconvert.sb","dec_635278487")
'LDProcess.Start((Program.Directory)+"\baseconvert.sb","dA_ai880n")

'Troubleshooting * how to know if there's an error:
'Clicks once - doesn't understand the argument
'Clicks twice - too many arguments or none at all

'Output * where do the results go:
'It writes the converted deviation ID into a text file "vysledek.mato" in the EXE's directory.
'Feel free to change the filename on lines 48 and 52 or replace it with something like "Clipboard.SetText"
